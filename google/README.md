## Documentation

Imagine you have a magical notebook where you can create your own pages. In this example:

#### DOCTYPE html:
Think of it like a special spell at the beginning that tells the computer, "Hey, this is a webpage!"

#### html: 
This is like saying, "Everything inside this notebook is part of my webpage."

#### head:
Think of it as the top part of your page where you put the title, just like naming your favorite story.

#### title: 
This is where you give your webpage a name, like "My First Website."

#### body: 
This is the main part of your page, where you put all the fun stuff.

#### a (anchor) tag: 
This is like a magic portal. When you click on it (like saying a magic word), it takes you to another place (website). In this case, it's set to take you to Google.

#### href: 
It's like telling the portal where to go. In this case, it says, "Go to https://www.google.com."

#### target:
 It's like deciding how the portal should open. Here, it's set to open in the same place you are now.

#### title: 
This is like a hint you give when someone hovers over the magic portal. It says, "This takes you to Google!"

#### Google:
 This is what you see on the magic portal. When you click it, you go to Google's world!

So, the whole magic spell is a way to create a page where you can click on a special word (Google) and it takes you to another exciting place on the internet!
