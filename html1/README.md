## Documentation

Imagine you created a special webpage just for you, and it's all about something you love – pizza! Here's what you did:

#### DOCTYPE html: 
It's like telling the computer, "Get ready, I'm making a webpage!"

#### html: 
This is where you say, "Everything inside here is part of my webpage."

#### head: 
This is like the top part where you give your webpage a cool name, like "My Awesome Website."

#### title: 
This is where you name your webpage.

#### body: 
This is the main part where you put all the fun stuff.

#### h1 to h6: 
These are like big and small titles, and each one says, "I really, really like pizza" in a different way.

#### p: 
This is a little space where you can write something. You wrote, "Hi there! I made a cool website, and I really, really like pizza! Let me tell you a bit about it."

So, your webpage is like a special place on the internet where you tell everyone about your love for pizza!
