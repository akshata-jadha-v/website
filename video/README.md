## Documentation

Imagine you're making a super cool webpage with a video! Here's what's happening:

#### DOCTYPE html: 
This is like a special spell that tells the computer, "Hey, get ready, I'm creating a webpage!"

#### html: 
This is where you say, "Everything inside here is part of my webpage."

#### head: 
This is like the top part where you give your webpage a cool name, like "My First Fun Website."

#### title: 
This is where you name your webpage.

#### body: 
This is the main part where you put all the fun stuff.

#### video: 
This is like a magic TV on your webpage that plays videos.

#### controls: 
These are like buttons on the video player - play, pause, and all that fun stuff.

#### autoplay: 
This is like saying, "As soon as you open my webpage, let's start the video automatically."

#### muted: 
This means the video is silent. It's like when you watch videos on a phone, and the sound is off until you turn it on.

#### loop: 
This is like saying, "Keep playing the video over and over like a loop."

#### width="500": 
This is how you tell the computer how big or small you want the video player to be.

#### source: 
This is like telling the computer where to find the video. It's like saying, "Hey, the video is in these two places: 'video.mp4' and 'video.webm.'"

Oops, this browser can't play videos : This is a message for anyone who opens your webpage with a browser that can't play videos. It's like saying, "Oops, sorry, your browser can't join the video party."

So, your webpage is like a magic TV that plays a fun video when you open it!
