## Documentation

Imagine you're making a special webpage about space, and you want to show a picture of the moon. Here's how it works:

#### DOCTYPE html: 
It's like saying, "Get ready, computer, I'm creating a webpage!"

#### html: 
This is where you say, "Everything inside here is part of my webpage."

#### head: 
This is like the top part where you give your webpage a cool name, like "My First Website."

#### title: 
This is where you name your webpage.

#### body: 
This is the main part of your webpage where you put all the interesting stuff.

#### img: 
This is like a magic tool to put pictures on your webpage.

#### src="/moon.png": 
It's like saying, "Hey computer, the picture of the moon is in this special place called 'moon.png.'"

#### height="300" width="300": 
This is how you tell the computer how big or small you want the moon picture to be. You said, "Make it 300 units tall and 300 units wide."

#### alt:
"This is a picture of the moon": This is a message for anyone who can't see the picture. It says, "Imagine this is a picture of the moon."

#### title="moon": 
This is like a little label for the picture. When you hover your mouse over it, it says, "This is the moon!"

So, your webpage is like a magical space book, and when you open it, you see a big, beautiful picture of the moon!
