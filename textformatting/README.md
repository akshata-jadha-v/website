## Documentation

Imagine you're writing a letter, and you want to make it look interesting with different styles. In the world of making websites, we use special codes to do that.

#### Normal Text:

Just like your regular writing.

#### Bold Text:

If you want to make something stand out a lot, like making it really strong or important, you use <b> tags. It's like writing with a thick marker.

#### Italic Text:

When you want to add a bit of style or emphasis, you use <i> tags. It's like writing in a slanted way.

#### Big Text:

If you want to shout or make something look bigger, you use <big> tags. It's like writing in a really large font.

#### Small Text:

When you want to whisper or make something look smaller, you use <small> tags. It's like writing in a tiny font.

#### Subscript and Superscript:

If you're writing a math formula or something below the line, you use <sub> tags (subscript). If it's above the line, you use <sup> tags (superscript).

#### Inserted and Deleted Text:

If you're adding new words, you use <ins> tags (inserted). If you're taking away words, you use <del> tags (deleted).

#### Marked Text:

When you want to highlight something, you use <mark> tags. It's like using a highlighter on paper.

So, these special codes help make your website text look cool and different, just like using various pens and markers when you write on paper.
