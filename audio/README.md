## Documentation

Imagine you have a magical webpage that plays music! Here's how it works:

#### DOCTYPE html: 
This is like a special spell to tell the computer, "Hey, get ready, we're making a webpage!"

#### html: 
This is where you say, "Everything inside this magic webpage belongs together."

#### head: 
This is like the top part of your magic webpage where you give it a cool name, like "My First Music Player."

#### title: 
This is where you name your magical music player.

#### body: 
This is the main part of your magic webpage where all the fun happens.

#### audio controls: 
Imagine a magic music player with buttons to play, pause, and adjust the volume. That's what this does.

#### autoplay: 
This is like saying, "As soon as you open the magic webpage, let's start the music automatically."

#### muted: 
This means the music is silent for now. It's like when you first open a game and the sound is off until you turn it on.

#### loop: 
This is like saying, "Keep playing the music over and over like a loop."

#### source: 
Think of it as telling your magic music player where to find the music. It's like saying, "Hey, the music is in these two places: 'LITE BRITE - Density & Time.mp3' and 'LITE BRITE - Density & Time.wav'."

#### Your browser can't play music: 
This is a message for when someone opens your magic webpage with a browser that doesn't understand how to play music. It's like saying, "Oops, sorry, your browser can't join the music party."

So, your magic webpage is like a special place where you can listen to music, and it even knows how to start playing as soon as you open it!
