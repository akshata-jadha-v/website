## Documentation

#### Document Type Declaration (!DOCTYPE html):

This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.

#### HTML Structure (html, head, title, body):

* The main structure of an HTML document.

* head contains information about the webpage, and title sets the title displayed in the browser tab.

* body is where the content of the webpage goes.

#### Background Color (style="background-color: black;"):

* The whole webpage has a black background. The style attribute is like giving the webpage some special looks.

#### Headings (h1):

* Three big headings saying "Hello!" in different colors.

* The first is red (style="color: red;"), the second is a nice shade of green (style="color: rgb(112, 186, 123);"), and the third is a special kind of green (style="color: #45523d;").

#### Paragraph (p):

* A paragraph (text box) with a background color (style="background-color: #45523d;") of a specific green and white text color (style="color: aliceblue;").

* It contains some placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum) talking about something but doesn't make much sense. It's there just to show how text looks inside the box.

In essence, this code is like a recipe for a webpage. It sets the background color, writes big colorful greetings, and has a colorful text box for some information. When you open this in a web browser, you'll see your own little designed webpage! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€
